# Hexagonal Grid Game - Task List

## Setup

- [x] Set up the development environment (Python, IDE, etc.)
- [x] Set up the virtual environment
- [x] Choose a version control system (e.g., Git)

## Hexagonal Grid

- [ ] Create a `HexCell` class to store cell properties (terrain, has_object, etc.)
- [ ] Implement a function to generate a hexagonal grid using a 2D list
- [ ] Decide on the grid size (width and height)
- [ ] Assign terrain types to the grid cells (e.g., grass, water, etc.)

## Movable Objects

- [ ] Create a list of movable objects with their properties (id, type, position, etc.)
- [ ] Implement a function to add movable objects to the hexagonal grid
- [ ] Define object types and their respective behaviors (e.g., player, enemy, etc.)

## Saving and Loading Data

- [ ] Save the hexagonal grid data and movable objects data in separate JSON files
- [ ] Implement functions to load the saved grid and movable objects data from JSON files

## Game Mechanics

- [ ] Implement player movement on the hexagonal grid
- [ ] Design a user interface to display the grid and objects
- [ ] Define rules for interactions between objects (e.g., combat, item collection, etc.)
- [ ] Implement a turn-based system or real-time system, depending on the game design

## Additional Features

- [ ] Add obstacles or impassable terrain to the grid
- [ ] Implement AI for non-player characters (e.g., enemies, NPCs, etc.)
- [ ] Design a level progression system or a map generator
- [ ] Implement a save and load system for game progress

## Polish and Testing

- [ ] Test the game mechanics and fix any issues
- [ ] Optimize the game performance (e.g., rendering, loading times, etc.)
- [ ] Add sound effects and music
- [ ] Create appealing visuals and animations

## Documentation and Deployment

- [ ] Write user documentation (how to play, controls, etc.)
- [ ] Create a repository and publish the source code
- [ ] Package and distribute the game (e.g., standalone executable, web, etc.)
